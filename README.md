  * Can view clubs and their events.
  * Can rate the events.
* Event
  * Must have an event title, description, time, and register feature.
  * Can also contain posters and announcement banners.
  * Should also have event reports, proposals, and other supporting documents (only visible to clubs and administrators).
  * Real time registration and check-in stats [brownie].
  * Auto generating event analytics reports after the end of an event [brownie]. 
* Club
